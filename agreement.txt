The rules are simple: 
* Be excellent to each other.
* Everyone here uses their common names. 
* Anything you say stays for 18 months. What you say matters and will stay. But not forever. 
* Respect each other's privacy. Any content posted here is not to be reposted elsewhere.

Each board may have additional rules which you will find in a sticky topic at the top of the board. You will be held to those rules whether you read them or not.
